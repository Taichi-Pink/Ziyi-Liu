I am a 5th year PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics, Yale University. My research concentration is designing and developing statistical and machine learning tools for analysis of genomic datasets. I am interested in learning more about state-of-the-art Learning methods, and applying them to solve real world problems.


### Education:
- **Yale University** (2013 - 2018)   
  Ph.D of Biostatistics
- **Peking University** (2009 - 2013)   
  Bachelor of Mathematics


### Softwares:
- [**PKB2**](https://github.com/zengliX/PKB2), 2018:      
	A general kernel-boosting framework. Use clinical features and gene expression from typical cancer genomic study datasets to predict outcomes of interest. Support classification, regression, and survival analysis.

- [**SIFA**](https://github.com/zengliX/SIFA) (tumor **S**ubclone **I**dentification by **F**eature **A**llocation), 2017:            
	a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify tumor subclones and infer phylogenetic tree from WGS data
 
- [**PKB**](https://github.com/zengliX/PKB) (**P**athway-based **K**ernel **B**oosting), 2017:      
	a boosting framework using gene expression and pathway information for classification
